            The Fate of the Furious (alternatively known as F8 and titled on-screen as Fast & Furious 8 internationally) 
            is a 2017 American action film directed by F. Gary Gray and written 
            by Chris Morgan. It is the sequel to Furious 7 (2015) and the eighth
             installment in the Fast & Furious franchise. The film stars Vin 
             Diesel, Dwayne Johnson, Jason Statham, Michelle Rodriguez, Tyrese
              Gibson, Chris "Ludacris" Bridges, Scott Eastwood, Nathalie
               Emmanuel, Elsa Pataky, Kurt Russell, and Charlize Theron.
                In the film, Dominic Toretto has settled down with his wife 
                Letty Ortiz, until cyberterrorist Cipher coerces him into
                 working for her and turns him against his team, forcing 
                 them to find Dom and take down Cipher

            Plans for an eighth installment were first announced
             in March 2015 when Diesel appeared on Jimmy Kimmel Live!
              and announced that the film would be set in New York City. 
              Preparations for the film began immediately after the release
               of Furious 7, with Diesel, Morgan, and producer Neal H. Moritz
                re-signing. After setting an initial release date in that same month, casting 
                took place between April and June. In October, Gray was announced to direct 
                the film in the place of James Wan, who had directed the previous installment. Principal photography
                 began in March 2016 in locations such as Mývatn, Havana, Atlanta, Cleveland, and New York City,
                 continuing the franchise's tradition of filming around the world. With an estimated production budget
                  of up to $270 million, it is one of the most expensive films ever made.
The Fate of the Furious premiered in Berlin on April 4, 2017 and was theatrically
 released in conventional and IMAX theaters in the United States
  on April 14 by Universal Pictures. The film received mixed
   reviews from critics who praised the performances and action
    sequences but criticism for its story, Theron's character, 
    self-referential humor and runtime. Others deemed the film
     unnecessary in the wake of Walker's tribute in Furious 7.
      Despite the mixed reception, the film was a box office success,
       grossing over $1.2 billion worldwide, making it the nineteenth
        film (and the second in the franchise, after Furious 7) to gross 
        over $1 billion, the third-highest-grossing film of 2017, and the
         eleventh highest-grossing film of all time. It also grossed
          $541.9 million worldwide during its opening weekend, which
           made it the highest-grossing worldwide opening of all time
            until the release of Avengers: Infinity War (2018). The 
            sequel, F9, was released internationally in May 2021 and 
            released in the United States in June 2021.
